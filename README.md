# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Automobile
# Objective 
Perform an in-depth ecploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses,and validate assumptions using statistical and graphical techniques.
# Dataset
* Name : Automobile
* Source: "austo_automobile+%282%29+%281%29.csv"
* Description: 1. Understanding the Data
Data Collection: Gather the automobile dataset. It could include various features such as the make, model, year, engine size, horsepower, weight, fuel efficiency, price, and more.
Data Inspection: Review the datasetâ€™s structure (rows, columns), types of variables (categorical, numerical), and the first few rows to get a sense of the data.
2. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Check for missing values in the dataset and decide how to handle them (e.g., imputation, deletion, or using default values).
Duplicate Data: Identify and remove any duplicate rows.
Outliers: Look for any extreme values that may indicate incorrect data entry, especially in features like price or horsepower.
3. Descriptive Statistics
Numerical Features: Compute basic statistics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles for numerical columns such as price, weight, and engine size.
Categorical Features: Examine the distribution of categorical features (e.g., car make, model, fuel type) by counting occurrences of each category.
4. Data Visualization
Histograms: Plot histograms for numerical features like price, horsepower, and weight to understand the distribution of each variable.
Boxplots: Create boxplots to visualize the spread and identify potential outliers in numerical features.
Correlation Heatmap: Use a heatmap to visualize the correlation between numerical features. For example, check if engine size correlates with price or weight.
Scatter Plots: Generate scatter plots to explore relationships between variables. For example, plot price against horsepower or weight.
Pairplots: Use pairwise plots to observe the relationship between multiple numerical features.
5. Analyzing Relationships Between Variables
Categorical vs. Numerical: Compare numerical variables (like price) across categories such as car make or fuel type using boxplots or bar plots.
Categorical vs. Categorical: If you have two categorical features (e.g., car make and fuel type), use contingency tables or stacked bar plots to visualize the relationship.
6. Feature Engineering
Creating New Features: Sometimes, you can derive new features that may be useful for further analysis, such as calculating the power-to-weight ratio or the age of the car.
Normalization/Scaling: If needed, scale or normalize numerical features to ensure consistency in modeling (e.g., engine size vs. weight).
7. Identifying Patterns and Insights
Price Distribution: Explore how different factors (like engine size, car brand, or fuel type) influence the price of the car.
Fuel Efficiency: Analyze how features like weight, engine size, and number of cylinders affect the car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon).
Market Trends: Check trends based on year of manufacture, such as the shift toward electric or hybrid vehicles.
8. Outliers and Anomalies
Identifying Extreme Values: Look for outliers in variables like price, horsepower, or weight that could skew analysis or modeling.
Treatment of Outliers: Decide whether to remove or transform outliers based on their impact on the dataset.
9. Summarizing Findings
Key Insights: Summarize the key insights from the EDA, such as which features most strongly correlate with price or fuel efficiency.
Prepare for Modeling: Based on the EDA, decide which features are relevant for machine learning models and how the data should be prepared for model building.
10. Additional Techniques
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): If the dataset has many features, PCA can help reduce dimensionality while retaining most of the variance in the data.
Clustering: Perform clustering (e.g., K-means) to find groups of cars with similar characteristics.
By completing these steps, you'll have a better understanding of the dataset, allowing for informed decisions about which features to use in predictive modeling or deeper statistical analysis.

* # Conclusion
* The EDA on the automobile dataset reveals patterns, correlations, and data quality issues. By cleaning the data, handling missing values, and identifying outliers, we ensure reliable analysis. Visualizations highlight key relationships, such as how horsepower and weight affect price. The insights from EDA guide feature selection and data preparation, setting the stage for more accurate predictive modeling.
